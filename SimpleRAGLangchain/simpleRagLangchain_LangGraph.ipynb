A good medical history is important. The sur-\\ngeon will want to know about any history of thyroid dis-\\nease, hypertension, or eye problems, which may\\nincrease the risk of complications.\\nDescription\\nBlepharoplasty can be performed on the upper or\\nlower eyelid; it can involve the removal of excess skin\\nand fat deposits and the tightening of selected muscles\\nsurrounding the eyelids. The goal is to provide a more\\nyouthful appearance.\\nThe surgeon will begin by deciding whether excess\\nskin,fat deposits,or muscle looseness are at fault. While\\nthe patient is sitting upright,the surgeon will mark on the\\nskin where incisions will be made. Care will be taken to\\nhide the incision lines in the natural skin folds above and\\nbelow the eye. The patient then receives injections of a\\nlocal anesthetic to numb the pain. Many surgeons also give\\nthe patient a sedative intravenously during the procedure.\\nAfter a small,crescent-shaped section of eyelid skin\\nis removed, the surgeon will work to tease out small\\npockets of fat that have collected in the lids. If muscle\\nlooseness is also a problem,the surgeon may trim tissue\\nor add a stitch to pull it tighter. Then the incision is\\nclosed with stitches.\\nIn some patients,fat deposits in the lower eyelid may\\nbe the only or primary problem. Such patients may be\\ngood candidates for transconjunctival blepharoplasty.
